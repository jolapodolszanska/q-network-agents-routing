**Abstract**

With limited data and complex image structures, accurate classification of medical images remains a significant challenge in AI-assisted diagnostics. This study presents a hybrid CNN model with a capsule network layer and dynamic routing mechanism, enhanced with a Deep Q network (DQN) agent, for MRI image classification in Alzheimer’s disease detection. The approach combines a capsule network that captures complex spatial patterns with dynamic routing, improving model adaptability. The DQN agent manages the weights and optimizes learning by interacting with the evolving environment. Experiments conducted on popular MRI datasets show that the model outperforms traditional methods, significantly improving classification accuracy and reducing misclassification rates. These results suggest that the approach has great potential for clinical applications, contributing to the accuracy and reliability of automated diagnostic systems.
